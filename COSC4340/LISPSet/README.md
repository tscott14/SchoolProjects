#  Lisp Set Operators
###### Implement various set operations using Lisp.

## Basic structure:
Four operations were implemented:
1. My_Member -- a membership checker. Ex: is element A in set B.
1. My_Union -- produce a set containing elements in eith sets A or B.
1. My_Intersection -- produce a set containing elements in both sets A and B.
1. My_Diffrence -- produce a set containing elements in the set A but not in the set B.

These functions were implemented using a purely functional approach.
