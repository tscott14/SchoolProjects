This was a school project that tasked us with creating an expression evaluator.

The specifics details and requirements to this project can be found in the [Assignment Outline PDF](./assignment/Pascal%20Programming%20Assignment.pdf) file.

To run this program on a Linux machine, first make sure you have [fpc](https://www.freepascal.org/) installed, then run:
```bash
    ./run.sh
```

Running this command should produce an output file defined where the **OUTPUT_FILE_PATH** constant points. A sample of this output can be found [here](./sample_output.txt)

The input and output file and directories can be configured at the top of the [Pascal source file](./main.pas).

> **Note:** This program is also able to parse both DOS and UNIX formatted text files.
