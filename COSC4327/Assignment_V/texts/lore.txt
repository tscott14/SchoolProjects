Welcome to Middle Earth, adventurer! In this Lord of the Rings themed game, you will embark on a journey to find the key that will allow you to escape this land and embark unto the Western haven. 

Your quest will take you through various lands, each with their own challenges and clues. You must explore every nook and cranny, talk to the inhabitants, and collect any items that may be of use. 

Be warned, danger lurks around every corner. You may encounter fierce creatures, treacherous terrain, and cunning enemies. (not really) But fear not, for you have the skills and knowledge to overcome any obstacle.

As you progress through the game, you will collect keys that hold the secrets to your escape. These keys will only be revealed once you have found all the clues in each land. So keep your eyes peeled and your wits about you.
