# Overlappd

Overlappd is a calendar conflict resolver that caters to small teams. It is a Software as a Service (SaaS) that encompasses various ends of SaaS, with design being focused on UI/UX, software stack implementation, and documentation.

The primary goal of Overlappd is to provide a user-friendly webpage that allows groups of people, ideally small groups, to input their schedules and find opportune times for meetings or other occasions. It is built on the MERN stack, which comprises [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/), [ReactJS](https://react.dev/), and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en). The server (backend) and client (frontend) are designated in their own paths.

As a member of the team, my primary responsibility was to design a REST API for the front-end to work with, implement the backend using this API, and produce documentation of said API. The project has been slightly modified since the end of the course, but the original can be found [here](https://github.com/overlappd-com/overlappd-prod). This modified edition improves the UI/UX design used in the original course capstone.

In addition, the Overlappd demo can be viewed [here](https://overlappd.com/).

## Project Not Completed

Since the primary reason for this project's developement was for our Software Development course, the reasons for completing this SaaS have not existed since the end of the semester. As a direct result, this service is NOT complete nor will it likely be complete in the future.

Small tweaks may be applied, such as improved UI/UX design but the core of this service will likely remain as currently presented.
